        <h1>Travel to Kazakhstan!</h1>
        <p> Kazakhstan, landlocked country of Central Asia. It is bounded on the northwest and north by Russia, on the east by China, and on the south by Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, the Aral Sea, and Turkmenistan; the Caspian Sea bounds Kazakhstan to the southwest. Kazakhstan is the largest country in Central Asia and the ninth largest in the world. Between its most distant points, Kazakhstan measures about 1,820 miles (2,930 kilometres) east to west and 960 miles north to south. While Kazakhstan was not considered by authorities in the former Soviet Union to be a part of Central Asia, it does have physical and cultural geographic characteristics similar to those of the other Central Asian countries. The capital is Astana (formerly Nur-Sultan, Aqmola, and Tselinograd), in the north-central part of the country. Kazakhstan, formerly a constituent (union) republic of the U.S.S.R., declared independence on December 16, 1991. </p>

        <p>Kazakhstan’s great mineral resources and arable lands have long aroused the envy of outsiders, and the resulting exploitation has generated environmental and political problems. The forced settlement of the nomadic Kazakhs in the Soviet period, combined with large-scale Slavic in-migration, strikingly altered the Kazakh way of life and led to considerable settlement and urbanization in Kazakhstan. The Kazakhs’ traditional customs uneasily coexist alongside incursions of the modern world.</p>

        <h2>Land</h2>
        <p>Lowlands make up one-third of Kazakhstan’s huge expanse, hilly plateaus and plains account for nearly half, and low mountainous regions about one-fifth. Kazakhstan’s highest point, Mount Khan-Tengri (Han-t’eng-ko-li Peak) at 22,949 feet (6,995 metres), in the Tien Shan range on the border between Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and China, contrasts with the flat or rolling terrain of most of the republic. The western and southwestern parts of the republic are dominated by the low-lying Caspian Depression, which at its lowest point lies some 95 feet below sea level. </p>

        <h2 id="top3">Top 3 Reasons to visit KZ</h2>
        <h3>1.The people</h3>
        <p>It is often said it’s the <em>people</em> that make a destination.</p>

        <p>I’ve met a few people from Kazakhstan on my travels, I’ve always connected with them and found them very easy going and friendly. They are unassuming, and usually enormously proud of where they are from.</p>

        <p>From the moment we landed in Turkestan, we felt the same. We were always greeted with a friendly smile by locals and guides. And even better, it wasn’t a big deal. No one was particularly bothered to see a group of tourists, we were very much left to it. That was nice.</p>

        <p>Kazakhstan is so <strong>multicultural</strong> and inclusive. I’ll touch on religion more in a point later. But Russian and Kazakh people live together in harmony despite their past. And this culture is very much felt by visitors, and I loved it. </p>

        <h3>2.The Nature & Wildlife</h3>
        <p>I was astonished to find out just how much <strong>wildlife</strong> can be found in Kazakhstan. This is a real gem for anyone interested in birdlife, big cats, or safaris.</p>
        <p>
            Firstly, the national animal of Kazakhstan is the <em>Steppe Eagle</em>, which can be seen on their flag. You can also commonly see <strong>Golden Eagles</strong>; you’ll certainly see some in captivity. Nonetheless some people consider the Snow Leopard the national symbol. These extremely rare and endangered cats are protected in Kazakhstan and have recently been spotted in the <strong>Katon-Karagai National Park</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are not the only predators found in Kazakhstan; they also have Eurasian Brown Bear, Wolf, Lynx and Wildcats. Naturally, you are unlikely to encounter these animals on your trip unless you are specifically looking for them and travelling with a local wildlife expert.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the <strong>Altyn Emel National Park and Tien Shan mountains</strong> are well-known among birdwatchers. You’ll need to go with a specialist guide, but it’s common to see Himalayan Snowcock, Himalayan Rubythroat, Guldenstadt’s Redstart and possibly even nesting Ibisbill.</p>

        <h3>3.The Mountains</h3>
        <p>Another fantastic example of diversity. Any city surrounded by intimidating snow-capped peaks has something special about it. This is <strong>Almaty</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wherever you turn in Almaty you’ll see mountains in the distance. I was blown away on the flight in, staring out the window like an excited child (I advise you to request a window seat for your flight into Almaty).
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the best parts about this is the easy access Almaty has to the <strong>Shymbulak Ski Resort</strong>. Some of my favourite cities in the world have a ski resort on their doorstep, one day I will live in a city like this. Just 20-30 mins drive from the city centre and you can get to Shymbulak.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shymbulak is a world-famous ski resort, known for its mild temperature and long snow season. They have over 20 lifts and a cable car. I had been told it’s a bucket list ski resort by some friends from Moscow who visit every year, so it’s on the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it’s also full of adventure in summer too. From hiking and buggy riding to horse riding. Just up the road they have the highest mountainous ice rink in the world, used by athletes from all round the world to train. My kind of place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last but not least, if you’re into hiking, I highly recommend checking this hiking tour out, which starts from Almaty and takes you on a multiple-hour trek with experienced guides – One of the best activities!</p>
